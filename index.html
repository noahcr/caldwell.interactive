		<h1 class="headline">Rural Scotland on the Edge of Independence</h1>

		<p class="subhead">In the summer of 2014, as Scotland prepared to vote on independence, I toured its rural coast to capture a nation making up its mind.</p>

		<p>The media coverage of Scotland's 2014 independence referendum focused heavily on the nation's populous Lowland beltway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. This coverage, although thorough, failed to highlight the unique political, social and cultural identities in rural Scotland - and how this patchwork could affect the outcome of the September vote.</p>

		<p>Rural Scots islanders, for example, were concerned that ferry rates would rise if Scotland broke away. On the other hand, many coastal fishermen hoped that independence would ease the Crown Estate's chokehold on marine territorial rights. Farther north, in Orkney and Shetland, many people identify with Scandinavia more than Britain, betraying the lasting remnants of hundreds of years of Viking domination. That far north, London is a mere afterthought - but so is Edinburgh, which would be the capital of an independent Scotland.</p>

		<p>During the month before the referendum, I bicycled around the coast of Scotland, hoping to glimpse more of a nation of the edge of breaking away from once-mighty Britain. I published <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/17/scotland-s-yes-campaign-and-the-myth-of-scottish-equality.html">a feature on The Daily Beast</a> about how Scots' notions of equality and fairness could affect the vote; I also grabbed a few pictures along the way - snapshots of a rural nation contemplating its future.</p>
